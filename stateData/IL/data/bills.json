Restores certain provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 concerning cash bail to the form in which they existed before their amendment by Public Act 101-652 by amendment or reenactment with specified modifications. Establishes additional pretrial procedures. Amends the Statute on Statutes to provide that whenever there is a reference in any Act to the term \"pretrial release\", \"denial of pretrial release\", \"conditions of pretrial release\", or \"violations of the conditions of pretrial release\", the terms shall be construed to mean \"bail\", \"denial of bail\", \"conditions of bail\", or \"forfeiture of bail\" respectively.

Requires the Department of Transportation, in coordination with the Illinois State Police, to establish the Highway Work Zone Speed Control Program for the purposes of enforcing the speed limits established for construction or maintenance speed zones. Requires the Illinois State Police, in conjunction with the Department of Transportation and the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, to set up and operate automated traffic control systems in highway construction and maintenance speed zones to detect violations of posted work zone speed limits. Allows the Department of Transportation or the Illinois State Police to employ automated traffic control system operators to operate automated traffic control systems in construction or maintenance speed zones. Provides, with exceptions, that information and photographs or recorded images collected under the Program are not discoverable by court order as evidence in a proceeding. Requires information and photographs or recorded images collected under the Program to be destroyed not later than 2 years after the date the information and photographs or recorded images are collected. Provides that information and photographs or recorded images collected under the Program are the exclusive property of the State and not the property of the manufacturer or vendor of the automated traffic control system. Prohibits the use of a photograph or recorded image obtained through the use of an automated traffic control system for the purpose of enforcing a traffic offense. Provides that a person who owns a motor vehicle that is identified by an automated traffic control system as operating in a construction or maintenance speed zone at a speed in excess of the posted speed limit commits a civil law violation that is punishable by a minimum fine of $100 and a maximum fine of $200. Grants rulemaking authority to the Department of Transportation to implement and administer the Act. Makes other changes. Makes corresponding changes in the Freedom of Information Act and the Illinois Vehicle Code. Repeals the Automated Traffic Control Systems in Highway Construction or Maintenance Zones Act.

Amends the Expressway Camera Act. Provides that, as used in the Act, \"forcible felony\" means trafficking in persons and involuntary servitude (in addition to other specified offenses). Includes the counties of Lee, Ogle, and Whiteside in the program to increase cameras along expressways and the State highway system. Provides that images from the cameras, including, but not limited to, images of license plates collected by state-operated cameras and cameras operated by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, may be used by any law enforcement agency conducting an active law enforcement investigation. Removes provision allowing images from the cameras to be used by any law enforcement agency conducting an active law enforcement investigation. Provides that all images from the cameras that are exported through a law enforcement database shall be deleted from that law enforcement database within 120 days, unless the images are relevant to an ongoing investigation or pending criminal trial. Provides that any forcible felony, gunrunning, or firearms trafficking offense, as specified, respectively, committed on an expressway monitored by a camera system funded by money from the Road Fund or money from the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority and investigated by officers of the Illinois State Police may be prosecuted by the Attorney General or the State's Attorney where the offense was committed. Provides that the Act supersedes provisions in the Toll Highway Act regarding the confidentiality of personally identifiable information obtained through electronic toll collection systems. Provides that the Act is repealed on July 1, 2028 (rather than July 1, 2025). Effective immediately.",

Provides that a carrier may not deliver to a consumer a package known by the carrier to contain wine unless the consignor is a licensed winery shipper or registered third-party provider and the carrier has verified that license or registration for the current license period. Requires winery shippers, third-party providers, and carriers to file with the Illinois Liquor Control Commission a monthly report containing specified information concerning wine shipments. Provides that the State Commission may suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or renew a license to manufacture, distribute, or sell alcoholic liquor issued by the State Commission if the State Commission finds, after notice and an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing, that the person holding the license has shipped alcoholic liquor into another state in violation of that state's law.

Provides that a health insurer or its agents shall not publish or otherwise reveal information regarding the actual amount of rebates a health insurer receives on a product or therapeutic class of products, manufacturer-specific basis, or pharmacy-specific basis and that the information is confidential. Defines terms. Amends the Freedom of Information Act to make a conforming change. Amends the Pharmacy Practice Act. Provides that a pharmacist may substitute a biological product (instead of an interchangeable biological product) if, among other requirements, the product being considered for substitution is either the reference product or a product approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a biosimilar of the prescribed biological product (instead of if the substituted product has been determined by the United States Food and Drug Administration to be interchangeable with the prescribed biological product).

Provides that a law enforcement officer is \"in uniform\" only when primarily assigned to respond to law enforcement-related encounters or activities. Adds a definition for \"no expectation of privacy\". Provides that, on and after January 1, 2027, an officer no longer needs to provide notice of recording to a person that has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Removes provisions prohibiting officers from viewing recordings prior to completing a report. Modifies exceptions to destruction of camera recordings if a recording has been flagged and when recordings may be used to discipline law enforcement officers. Provides that recordings are only subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act when a recording is flagged due to the filing of a complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of force, arrest or detention, or resulting death or bodily harm and the subject of the encounter has a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time of the recording (removing other exceptions). Provides that only the subject of the recording or the subject's legal representative may obtain the portion of the recording containing the subject if the subject or legal representative provides written authorization to release the video. Makes other changes. Amends the Criminal Code of 2012 and Freedom of Information Act making conforming changes. Amends the Law Enforcement Camera Grant Act. Removes a requirement to include criminal and other violations and civil proceedings in which the cameras were used in reports that must be provided by a law enforcement agency receiving a grant for in-car video cameras or for officer-worn body cameras. Further amends the Criminal Code of 2012. Provides that a person also obstructs justice when, with intent to prevent the apprehension or obstruct the prosecution or defense of any person, he or she knowingly takes a body camera or any part of a body camera from a person known to be a peace officer. Provides that a violation is either a Class 1 felony or Class 2 felony.",

               "description": "Amends the Law Enforcement Officer-Worn Body Camera Act. Provides that the Act does not apply to school resource officers, undercover or covert officers, or officers that are employed in an administrative capacity, except when undercover or covert officers are conducting interviews. Provides that a law enforcement officer is \"in uniform\" only when primarily assigned to respond to law enforcement-related encounters or activities. Adds a definition for \"no expectation of privacy\". Provides that, on and after January 1, 2027, an officer no longer needs to provide notice of recording to a person that has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Removes provisions prohibiting officers from viewing recordings prior to completing a report. Modifies exceptions to destruction of camera recordings if a recording has been flagged and when recordings may be used to discipline law enforcement officers. Provides that recordings are only subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act when a recording is flagged due to the filing of a complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of force, arrest or detention, or resulting death or bodily harm and the subject of the encounter has a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time of the recording (removing other exceptions). Provides that only the subject of the recording or the subject's legal representative may obtain the portion of the recording containing the subject if the subject or legal representative provides written authorization to release the video. Makes other changes. Amends the Criminal Code of 2012 and Freedom of Information Act making conforming changes. Amends the Law Enforcement Camera Grant Act. Removes a requirement to include criminal and other violations and civil proceedings in which the cameras were used in reports that must be provided by a law enforcement agency receiving a grant for in-car video cameras or for officer-worn body cameras. Further amends the Criminal Code of 2012. Provides that a person also obstructs justice when, with intent to prevent the apprehension or obstruct the prosecution or defense of any person, he or she knowingly takes a body camera or any part of a body camera from a person known to be a peace officer. Provides that a violation is either a Class 1 felony or Class 2 felony.",

Provides that the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority shall establish and maintain a case tracking system and searchable public website that includes information about property seized and forfeited under State law and under any agreement with the federal government. Provides that it shall assign the responsibility to report each element to relevant agencies. Provides that the Authority shall also establish and maintain a searchable public website that includes the total amount of funds expended, in specified categories, which resulted from property seized, forfeited, and reported and the total value of seized and forfeited property held by the agency at the end of the reporting period. Provides that the Authority shall not require or disclose: (1) the names, addresses, contact information, or other personally identifying information of owners, other persons, or business entities or (2) the street addresses, vehicle identification number, or serial number of any conveyance. Provides that agencies that fully comply with reporting requirements within the designated timeframe shall be eligible for State recognition and additional funding opportunities through the Authority. Provides that the Authority shall make no disbursement of forfeiture proceeds to an agency or department unless the agency or department meets its reporting obligation. Provides that the Act is effective for the reporting period starting January 1, 2027. Creates the Criminal Forfeiture Process Act. Provides that the Act applies to the seizure and forfeiture of property used in and derived directly from specified crimes. Provides that for property to be forfeited before conviction, the State must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the property is directly linked to the criminal offense, and that immediate seizure is necessary to prevent its loss, destruction, or further use in criminal activity. Repeals the Seizure and Forfeiture Reporting Act, the Drug Asset Forfeiture Procedure Act, and the Forfeiture Article of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Amends various other Acts to make conforming changes.",
